	abstract = {Abstract Single-cell {RNA}-seq has enabled gene expression to be studied at an unprecedented resolution. The promise of this technology is attracting a growing user base for single-cell analysis methods. As more analysis tools are becoming available, it is becoming increasingly difficult to navigate this landscape and produce an up-to-date workflow to analyse one's data. Here, we detail the steps of a typical single-cell {RNA}-seq analysis, including pre-processing (quality control, normalization, data correction, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction) and cell- and gene-level downstream analysis. We formulate current best-practice recommendations for these steps based on independent comparison studies. We have integrated these best-practice recommendations into a workflow, which we apply to a public dataset to further illustrate how these steps work in practice. Our documented case study can be found at https://www.github.com/theislab/single-cell-tutorial. This review will serve as a workflow tutorial for new entrants into the field, and help established users update their analysis pipelines.},

Here, we use simulations based on five {scRNA}-seq library protocols in combination with nine realistic differential expression ({DE}) setups to systematically evaluate three mapping, four imputation, seven normalisation and four differential expression testing approaches resulting in {\textasciitilde}3000 pipelines, allowing us to also assess interactions among pipeline steps. We find that choices of normalisation and library preparation protocols have the biggest impact on {scRNA}-seq analyses. Specifically, we find that library preparation determines the ability to detect symmetric expression differences, while normalisation dominates pipeline performance in asymmetric {DE}-setups. Finally, we illustrate the importance of informed choices by showing that a good {scRNA}-seq pipeline can have the same impact on detecting a biological signal as quadrupling the sample size.},

	abstract = {Molecular noise is a natural phenomenon that is inherent to all biological systems1,2. How stochastic processes give rise to the robust outcomes that support tissue homeostasis remains unclear. Here we use single-molecule {RNA} fluorescent in situ hybridization ({smFISH}) on mouse stem cells derived from haematopoietic tissue to measure the transcription dynamics of three key genes that encode transcription factors: {PU}.1 (also known as Spi1), Gata1 and Gata2. We find that infrequent, stochastic bursts of transcription result in the co-expression of these antagonistic transcription factors in the majority of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Moreover, by pairing {smFISH} with time-lapse microscopy and the analysis of pedigrees, we find that although individual stem-cell clones produce descendants that are in transcriptionally related states—akin to a transcriptional priming phenomenon—the underlying transition dynamics between states are best captured by stochastic and reversible models. As such, a stochastic process can produce cellular behaviours that may be incorrectly inferred to have arisen from deterministic dynamics. We propose a model whereby the intrinsic stochasticity of gene expression facilitates, rather than impedes, the concomitant maintenance of transcriptional plasticity and stem cell robustness.},

Core cell populations mix transcription of pre-myeloid and pre-lymphoid programs, but do not mix erythroid or megakaryocyte programs with other fates. {CRISP}-seq perturbation analysis confirms our models and reveals that Cebpa regulates entry into all myeloid fates, while Irf8 and {PU}.1 deficiency block later differentiation towards monocyte or granulocyte fates.

	abstract = {Loss of skeletal integrity during ageing and disease is associated with an imbalance in the opposing actions of osteoblasts and osteoclasts1. Here we show that intrinsic ageing of skeletal stem cells ({SSCs})2 in mice alters signalling in the bone marrow niche and skews the differentiation of bone and blood lineages, leading to fragile bones that regenerate poorly. Functionally, aged {SSCs} have a decreased bone- and cartilage-forming potential but produce more stromal lineages that express high levels of pro-inflammatory and pro-resorptive cytokines. Single-cell {RNA}-sequencing studies link the functional loss to a diminished transcriptomic diversity of {SSCs} in aged mice, which thereby contributes to the transformation of the bone marrow niche. Exposure to a youthful circulation through heterochronic parabiosis or systemic reconstitution with young haematopoietic stem cells did not reverse the diminished osteochondrogenic activity of aged {SSCs}, or improve bone mass or skeletal healing parameters in aged mice. Conversely, the aged {SSC} lineage promoted osteoclastic activity and myeloid skewing by haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, suggesting that the ageing of {SSCs} is a driver of haematopoietic ageing. Deficient bone regeneration in aged mice could only be returned to youthful levels by applying a combinatorial treatment of {BMP}2 and a {CSF}1 antagonist locally to fractures, which reactivated aged {SSCs} and simultaneously ablated the inflammatory, pro-osteoclastic milieu. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the complex, multifactorial mechanisms that underlie skeletal ageing and offer prospects for rejuvenating the aged skeletal system.},

This process generates hundreds of blood progenitors, of which a fraction go on to become definitive {HSCs}. It is generally thought that most adult blood is derived from those {HSCs}, but to what extent other progenitors contribute to adult haematopoiesis is not known. Here we use in situ barcoding and classical fate mapping to assess the developmental and clonal origins of adult blood in mice. Our analysis uncovers an early wave of progenitor specification—independent of traditional {HSCs}—that begins soon after {EHT}. These embryonic multipotent progenitors ({eMPPs}) predominantly drive haematopoiesis in the young adult, have a decreasing yet lifelong contribution over time and are the predominant source of lymphoid output. Putative {eMPPs} are specified within intra-arterial haematopoietic clusters and represent one fate of the earliest haematopoietic progenitors. Altogether, our results reveal functional heterogeneity during the definitive wave that leads to distinct sources of adult blood.},

These {CX}3CR1+{SiglecF}+ transitional macrophages localized to the fibrotic niche and had a profibrotic effect in vivo.

	abstract = {The mammalian blood system, containing more than 10 distinct mature cell types, stands on one specific cell type, hematopoietic stem cell ({HSC}). Within the system, only {HSCs} possess the ability of both multipotency and self-renewal. Multipotency is the ability to differentiate into all functional blood cells. Self-renewal is the ability to give rise to {HSC} itself without differentiation. Since mature blood cells ({MBCs}) are predominantly short-lived, {HSCs} continuously provide more differentiated progenitors while properly maintaining the {HSC} pool size throughout life by precisely balancing self-renewal and differentiation. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of self-renewal and differentiation of {HSC} has been a central issue. In this review, we focus on the hierarchical structure of the hematopoietic system, the current understanding of microenvironment and molecular cues regulating self-renewal and differentiation of adult {HSCs}, and the currently emerging systems approaches to understand {HSC} biology.

Interestingly, not all long-lived hematopoietic cells derive from hematopoietic stem cells ({HSCs}). Here we review the current knowledge on {HSC}-dependent cell lineages and {HSC}-independent tissue-resident hematopoietic cells and how they arise during embryonic development. Classical embryological and genetic experiments, cell fate tracing data, single-cell imaging, and transcriptomics studies provide information on the molecular/cell trajectories that form the complete hematopoietic system. We also discuss the current developmentally informed efforts toward generating engraftable and multilineage blood cells.},

	abstract = {Ever since hematopoietic stem cells ({HSCs}) were first identified half a century ago, their differentiation roadmap has been extensively studied. The classical model of hematopoiesis has long held as a dogma that {HSCs} reside at the top of a hierarchy in which {HSCs} possess self-renewal capacity and can progressively give rise to all blood lineage cells. However, over the past several years, with advances in single cell technologies, this developmental scheme has been challenged. In this review, we discuss the evidence supporting heterogeneity within {HSC} and progenitor populations as well as the hierarchical models revised by novel approaches mainly in mouse system. These evolving views provide further understanding of hematopoiesis and highlight the complexity of hematopoietic differentiation.},

These and other findings challenge many aspects of the classical view of {HSC} biology. We review the most recent findings regarding the causes and consequences of {HSC} heterogeneity, discuss their far-reaching implications, and suggest that so-called continuum-based models may help consolidate apparently divergent experimental observations in this field.},

	abstract = {Trajectory inference approaches analyze genome-wide omics data from thousands of single cells and computationally infer the order of these cells along developmental trajectories. Although more than 70 trajectory inference tools have already been developed, it is challenging to compare their performance because the input they require and output models they produce vary substantially. Here, we benchmark 45 of these methods on 110 real and 229 synthetic datasets for cellular ordering, topology, scalability and usability. Our results highlight the complementarity of existing tools, and that the choice of method should depend mostly on the dataset dimensions and trajectory topology. Based on these results, we develop a set of guidelines to help users select the best method for their dataset. Our freely available data and evaluation pipeline (https://benchmark.dynverse.org) will aid in the development of improved tools designed to analyze increasingly large and complex single-cell datasets.},

	abstract = {The haematopoietic stem cell ({HSC}) microenvironment in the bone marrow, termed the niche, ensures haematopoietic homeostasis by controlling the proliferation, self-renewal, differentiation and migration of {HSCs} and progenitor cells at steady state and in response to emergencies and injury. Improved methods for {HSC} isolation, driven by advances in single-cell and molecular technologies, have led to a better understanding of their behaviour, heterogeneity and lineage fate and of the niche cells and signals that regulate their function. Niche regulatory signals can be in the form of cell-bound or secreted factors and other local physical cues. A combination of technological advances in bone marrow imaging and genetic manipulation of crucial regulatory factors has enabled the identification of several candidate cell types regulating the niche, including both non-haematopoietic (for example, perivascular mesenchymal stem and endothelial cells) and {HSC}-derived (for example, megakaryocytes, macrophages and regulatory T cells), with better topographical understanding of {HSC} localization in the bone marrow. Here, we review advances in our understanding of {HSC} regulation by niches during homeostasis, ageing and cancer, and we discuss their implications for the development of therapies to rejuvenate aged {HSCs} or niches or to disrupt self-reinforcing malignant niches.},
